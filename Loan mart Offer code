Was a time when the only means for getting a short term loan was to head down to the Pawn Broker, and put something into Hock. More and more these days, lenders are prepared to take no security, as long as you can provide proof of employment and sufficient means to repay a loan. Such providers generally operate solely on the internet and the process from start to finish, application and cash in your account can be surprisingly quick, takin as little as 90 minute

These loans are designed for people who need cash in a hurry and don't involve the expensive and time-consuming applications most banks will put you though. You only need to answer a few simple questions for the pay day loan application and can have the funds the same day once approved.

The pay day loan application process is designed to be easy because these loans don't require the financial and background checks that other types of funding requires. Most pay day loans are for small amounts of money that is lent for a short period of time. These funds are guaranteed by your next paycheck and the risk to the lender is very low. They are essentially giving you an advance on money you will soon be earning. The benefit is that you'll have the funds you need today to cover your expenses.
